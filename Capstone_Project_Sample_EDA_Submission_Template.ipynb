        "1. Pie Chart: A pie chart is used to visualize proportions or percentages of a whole. It is particularly useful when you want to show the distribution of a categorical variable as parts of a whole. In the context of customer churn, a pie chart can effectively represent the proportion of churned customers (40%) and non-churned customers (60%) out of the total customer base. It provides a clear visual representation of the relative sizes of these categories and helps highlight the proportion of churned customers in relation to the overall customer base.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Bar Chart: A bar chart, on the other hand, is commonly used to compare and display the values of different categories. It is suitable for showing quantitative data across different groups or categories. In the context of maximum customer service calls by city, a bar chart is an appropriate choice as it allows for a visual comparison of the number of customer service calls for each city (Oakland, San Jose, San Francisco). The length of the bars represents the count of customer service calls, making it easy to identify the city with the highest call volume."
